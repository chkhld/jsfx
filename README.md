# chokehold JSFX
A variety of free [JSFX](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/js/) plugins I created for use in [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/).

Visit the [plugins index page](https://github.com/chkhld/jsfx/blob/main/PLUGINS.md) for an overview of all of my currently published JSFX plugins, including screenshots and short descriptions. _See the source files for more specific details and instructions._

## Installation
If you have the [ReaPack Extension](https://reapack.com/) installed, you can add the repository to Reaper with this URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chkhld/jsfx/master/index.xml
```
<br>

If you **don't** have ReaPack installed, you can also add these plugins on a per-file basis.
- Visit the [plugins index page](https://github.com/chkhld/jsfx/blob/master/PLUGINS.md) and download what you want from there, or [get the full release here](https://github.com/chkhld/jsfx/releases/).
- If you don't know what to do with these files, watch the [Reaper Blog tutorial](https://reaperblog.net/2015/06/quick-tip-how-to-install-js-plugins/) on how to install JSFX plugins.

## Support
This is just a fun project for me, I do this on the side to waste time or template C++ code, so don't expect too much of an effort. But if you find any bugs, or if you have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to report them in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/chkhld/jsfx/issues), I'll have a look there every now and then.
